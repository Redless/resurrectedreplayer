notes:

- i removed a bunch of the styling. no real reason for this. most stuff was unneeded

- opponent hp's are given in percentages whereas allied HP's are given in exact numbers, as per the client.

- supereffective is very annoying. can just look this up? or parse from replay?

- a line-by-line view: is HP percentages translated well enough?
- line by line parsing: effective or ineffective? what stuff do we not know about well enough?

- leech seed
- weather
- spikes and other hazards?
- stat boosts?
